/**
 * Checkpoint and ledger-range handling.
 *
 * The indexer persists the last fully processed ledger so that a missed or
 * failed scheduled run is safely retryable. Two rules matter:
 *
 * 1. A checkpoint only moves forward. Regressing it would re-index events, and
 *    while upserts are idempotent, a regression also risks masking a gap.
 * 2. A checkpoint is only advanced after the corresponding range has been
 *    written successfully. Advancing early would silently skip events.
 *
 * Ranges are bounded so a single invocation stays within its execution budget;
 * the next run resumes from the checkpoint. No ledger is ever skipped between
 * consecutive runs.
