/**
 * Reading a ledger range in full.
 *
 * The checkpoint only moves forward, so a range that is read incompletely is
 * never read again: whatever the missing events said about money moving is lost
 * for good. This module exists so that "read in full" is a property that can be
 * tested, rather than an assumption about how the RPC pages.
 *
 * The RPC addresses events in two mutually exclusive ways — a ledger range,
 * which bounds the scan, and a cursor, which continues it. Sending both is an
 * error (`-32602: ledger ranges and cursor cannot both be set`), so only the
 * first request of a scan carries a range and every later one carries the
 * cursor from the previous response.
 *
 * An earlier implementation instead advanced the next request's `startLedger`
 * to the highest ledger seen in the previous page. That loses events whenever a
 * page is filled entirely by a single ledger — the ledger's remaining events sit
 * after the page boundary, and the next request starts *past* them — and it
 * re-reads the boundary ledger in every other case. The cursor has neither
 * problem, which is what it is for.

 * carrying more than five contract IDs outright, so a watch list that outgrows
 * one filter would otherwise fail every run rather than degrade.
 *
 * Each contract appears in exactly one chunk, so an event is returned once and
 * the caller's ordering is all that remains to restore. The chunks are read one
 * after another rather than concurrently: the RPC is a shared public endpoint,
 * and a dozen parallel scans are a good way to be rate limited part-way through
 * a range that then cannot be advanced.
 *
 * Throws rather than returning a partial result whenever it cannot prove the
 * range was read in full. A partial result would be recorded and the checkpoint
 * advanced past it, which is indistinguishable from the events never existing.
